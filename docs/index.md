# cloudns Provider



## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "cloudns" {
  # Optionally provided by CLOUDNS_SUB_AUTH_ID
  sub_auth_id = 1234

  # Optionally provided by CLOUDNS_PASSWORD
  password = "verysecret"

  # Optional, ClouDNS currently maxxes out at 20 requests per second per ip. Defaults to 5.
  rate_limit = 5
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `auth_id` (Number, Sensitive) When using api users, this is the `auth-id`. It is read from the environment variable `CLOUDNS_AUTH_ID` if not passed explicitly. Mutually exclusive with `sub_auth_id`.
- `password` (String, Sensitive) This is the password associated with your auth-id or sub-auth-id. It is read from the environment variable `CLOUDNS_PASSWORD` if not passed explicitly.
- `rate_limit` (Number) Underlying rate limit (in API calls per second) to observe while interacting with ClouDNS. Defaults to 5 requests per second.
- `sub_auth_id` (Number, Sensitive) When using api sub-users, this is the `sub-auth-id`. It is read from the environment variable `CLOUDNS_SUB_AUTH_ID` if not passed explicitly. Mutually exclusive with `auth_id`.


### Import Records

Records can be imported using:

```sh
terraform import ADDR "zone/id"
```

Example record and its import command:

```hcl
resource "cloudns_dns_record" "some-record" {
  # ID: 123456789
  # something.cloudns.net 600 in A 1.2.3.4
  name  = ""
  zone  = "something.cloudns.net"
  type  = "A"
  value = "1.2.3.4"
  ttl   = "600"
}
```

```sh
terraform import cloudns_dns_record.some-record "something.cloudns.net/123456789"
```

### Import Zones

Zones can be imported using:

```sh
terraform import ADDR "recordId"
```

The recordId is the ID of the record on which the failover is activated

Example failover and its import command:

```hcl
resource "cloudns_dns_failover" "testzone-bg-http" {
  domain            = cloudns_dns_zone.sub-testzone-bg.domain
  recordid          = cloudns_dns_record.sub-testzone-bg-a["something"].id
  checktype         = "9"
  port              = "90"
  downeventhandler = "0"
  upeventhandler   = "0"
  mainip            = cloudns_dns_record.sub-testzone-bg-a["something"].value
  depends_on = [ cloudns_dns_zone.sub-testzone-bg ]
}
```

```sh
terraform import cloudns_dns_failover.testzone-bg-http "recordID"
```

### Import Failover

Failover can be imported using:

```sh
terraform import ADDR recordId
```

Example failover and its import command:

```hcl
resource "cloudns_dns_failover" "testzone-bg-http" {
  #recordId = 123456789
  domain            = cloudns_dns_zone.sub-testzone-bg.domain
  recordid          = cloudns_dns_record.sub-testzone-bg-a["something"].id
  checktype         = "9"
  port              = "90"
  downeventhandler = "0"
  upeventhandler   = "0"
  mainip            = cloudns_dns_record.sub-testzone-bg-a["something"].value
  depends_on = [ cloudns_dns_zone.sub-testzone-bg ]
}
```

```sh
terraform import cloudns_dns_failover.testzone-bg-http 123456789
```
